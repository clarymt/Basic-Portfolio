    <p1>Hey it's me! Where to begin with this boxed paragraph of self-indulgence? Hmmm... Let's start from right now. I am currently typing up a page with about 30% of the complete idea as to how this finish this assignment correctly. I'm enthusiastic to be doing this with my Friday afternoon daydreaming about the future! I'll let you in on a little secret...I really want a Corvette, my current job wont supplement the bones to put up for that. Speaking of, I was supposed to spray weed control on the University of Richmond today, but it rained this AM.</p1>
    
    <p2>As you can see, I'm on top of a mountain...it's kinda my "schtick." I hiked the Appalchian Trail in 2018. Yup.</p2>
    
    <p3>2,190.9 miles over the course of 5 1/2 months from Georgia to Maine!</p3>
